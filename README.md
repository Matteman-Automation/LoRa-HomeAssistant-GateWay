# LoRa-HomeAssistant-GateWay
The GateWay between LoRa and Home Assistant, special for sensors and other situations where WiFi is not stable or available.

A temperature sensor at the back of your garden, switching garden lights of even a monitor system for your car battery. With LoRa the distance is no problem anymore.

With this code you can create a GateWay between Home Assistant and	 LoRa. For this GateWay, I use MQTT to send and receive signals.
